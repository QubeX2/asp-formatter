## Usage

CMD/CTRL + P -> ASP Format

## Background

For a project I'm working on I needed a quick way to format left justified
readable code in ASP. So I made this extension for that. 

## Features

Formats classic ASP code.

Doesn't format HTML and JavaScript. Just tries to make ASP a little more
readable.

## Changes

See CHANGELOG

### 1.0.3

**Enjoy!**
